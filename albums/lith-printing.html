<p>Lith Printing is an alternative photographic process. The key difference to
regular darkroom printing lies in what is called <i>infectious development</i>.
Coarse grain like sandpaper, harsh contrast and a certain coloring characterize
the resulting prints. Without a doubt, it is one of the most interesting and
worthwhile darkroom printing techniques, adding to the printer's already mighty
toolbelt.</p>

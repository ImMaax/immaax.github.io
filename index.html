    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my homepage! This site serves as a permanent and ever-changing
      exhibition space for my personal photography. See below for the albums
      which I have sorted my photos into.

    <p>
      As most of my work is in the analog domain, almost all the images on this
      website are scans of darkroom prints from my archive. Many of my prints
      were created in the lith process, a specialty technique among darkroom
      printers. I utilize equipment ranging from small 35mm SLRs and obscure toy
      cameras all the way to a big and heavy 4x5" view camera.

      If you have any inquiries to make, do not hesitate to contact me. Also, if
      you would like to see more of my photos, especially more recent ones, feel
